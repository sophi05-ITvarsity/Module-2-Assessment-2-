                        <p><strong>An Epic Vision</strong></p>
                       
                        <p>Growing up in a beach-side town in Australia, our founder Nigel Austin started the Cotton On Group with an epic vision in mind. He wanted to take Our Aussie Lifestyle to the world, Doing Good along the way. And, although born into the rag trade, he had no idea what was about to unfold.</p>
                       
                        <p>The first market came and went without a sale, something that might’ve shaken any young entrepreneur. But, instead of letting this deter him, Nigel looked at the bigger picture and decided to switch things up. Returning a week later with a new offer, the jackets sold out. The difference? Customer obsession was now front of mind – something that still drives our decision-making to this day. By providing great value to our customer, without compromising on quality, he’d found the sweet spot.</p>
                       
                       <p>It’s our simple beginnings and lessons learnt from those early years that forged the path for how we still work today. And it’s what set us on the path to fulfilling our purpose; To make a positive difference in people’s lives while establishing one of Australia’s largest global fashion groups.</p>
                       
                       <p>Our culture and our product. We’ve depended on family and great mates since day one, so it makes sense that we consider our 20,000 team members to be exactly that – part of our global Cotton On Group family.

                        And our product? Effortless, on-trend and affordable – made responsibly, to be loved and lived in every day.
                        We create ‘The Aussie Edit’. It’s in touch with global trends, but not a literal interpretation. It’s authentic and we develop our ranges and prints in-house. It’s effortless but aspirational. It’s all about creating product that reflects our unique, laid-back Aussie lifestyle and doesn’t cost the earth.
                        We know our responsibility goes far beyond just selling great product. So, from the way we build our global teams to the way we source and develop our product ranges, we make sure we’re Doing Good every step of the way.</p>
