                       <p><strong>A CURATOR IN THE LUXURY LIFESTYLE MARKET</strong></p>
                       
                       <p>Leather Gallery is a family business at heart. With a grand vision of marrying modern technology to the time-honoured techniques of traditional craftsmanship, the “home of leather” was created. Crafting opulent furniture and décor pieces, our brand truly redefined the idea of luxurious living in South Africa.</p> 

                       <p>As the "home of leather furniture" we pride ourselves on the high quality of our genuine leather products. Our leather sofas are of the highest quality and feature full top grain leather that both looks and feels luxurious. While leather furniture such as leather couches and leather recliners is our forte, we have also mastered the art of creating top quality fabric sofas, wooden bedroom, dining room and living room furniture as well as other home and decor pieces.</p>

                       <p>Currently with 17 furniture stores based throughout KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Gauteng, we aspire to continue to grow and expand our furniture shops across the country to reach more of our customers. There is no better way to experience the beauty and luxurious comfort of our furniture than by experiencing it yourself by touring one of our furniture stores. While we grow our shops across the country, our online store serves as a virtual extension, offering our brands products nationwide.</p>
